Roasted chickpeas are a good source of protein and fiber and can be flavored with various spices such as garlic, paprika, and cumin. Kale chips are also a nutritious alternative that is low in calories and high in vitamins A, C, and K. They can be seasoned with nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper for added flavor.
